# Not Helper™ — The AI Therapist That Pretends To Care  
_(Disclaimer: It Doesn’t)_

_Not Helping™_ is a satirical AI therapy experience featuring multiple therapist personalities, voice synthesis, contextual responses, and a user-driven onboarding journey that evaluates your “damage level” before connecting you to a deeply unqualified AI professional.

This is not a mental health app. It’s a **product experiment in applied AI, persona design, and interactive storytelling.**

*(Recommended with sound — voice synthesis is part of the experience)*

## 🧩 What It Does

The product guides users through a tongue-in-cheek journey:

1. **Damage Assessment** — users self-report personality “issues”
2. **Therapist Selection** — choose from a roster of emotionally unavailable AI clinicians
3. **Reality Check** — contextual micro-insights based on time/day/choices
4. **Loading Sequence** — multi-stage sarcastic loader with fake error states
5. **Therapy Chat** — real-time session with voice, typing indicators, persona behavior
6. **The Disappointing Conclusion** — session summary + zero growth achieved

The goal:  
> **Simulate therapy… badly.**

---

## 🧠 Why This Exists

This project explores:

- **AI as character**, not assistant
- **Voice synthesis as UX**, not accessibility
- **Contextual humor** based on timing & input
- **Persona-driven LLM prompts**
- **Real-time interaction loops**
- **Satire as interface**
- **User state as narrative**

Not Helping™ reframes AI from  
> “How can AI solve problems?”  
to  
> “How can AI make things worse… entertainingly?”

## 🎭 Therapist Personalities

Each therapist has:

✔ distinct voice  
✔ prompt persona  
✔ conversational style  
✔ psychological flaws  
✔ professional incompetence

Examples include:

- **Dr. Void** — existential dread, low enthusiasm
- **Dr. Burnout** — corporate trauma incarnate
- **Dr. Dread** — bad vibes only
- **Dr. Karen** — judgmental, high condescension

---

## 🔊 Voice & Interaction

Sessions blend:

- **LLM-generated dialogue**
- **Voice synthesis (real-time)**
- **Progressive text reveal**
- **Typing indicators**
- **Playback control**
- **Message acknowledgement**
- **Session lifecycle events**

Voice is not a gimmick here —  
It shapes persona, timing, and comedic delivery.

---

## 🕹 Onboarding Journey

The UX intentionally borrows from:

✔ mobile apps  
✔ game UI  
✔ onboarding funnels  
✔ personality quizzes  
✔ narrative games

The result is a **guided comedic arc**, not an open chat box.

---

## 🧩 Technology Summary (Non-Exhaustive)

To avoid leaking implementation details or prompts, this is intentionally high-level:

- **Frontend:** React + Next.js + Tailwind (mostly client mode)
- **LLM layer:** Applied AI + persona pipelines
- **Socket layer:** Real-time events for chat, typing, voice playback
- **Voice:** Synthesis + timing + text rendering
- **State:** Client session state machine (multi-step journey)

## 🚫 What This Project Is *Not*

This is not:

✖ therapy  
✖ a self-help tool  
✖ a wellness product  
✖ clinically validated  
✖ emotionally supportive  
✖ useful in any measurable sense

It is **purely entertainment and product experimentation**, inspired by the creative misuse of AI.
